# SKSE Templates

> Templates of SKSE projects for Skyrim

_Follow links to templates below. Each one is in a separate "[Template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)" GitHub repository._

> All templates use [CommonLibSSE NG](https://github.com/CharmedBaryon/CommonLibSSE-NG) and should work on Skyrim SE, AE, GOG, and VR

## "Hello, world!"

This [Hello, world!](https://github.com/SkyrimScripting/SKSE_Template_HelloWorld) template is as simple as templates get!

Use this to confirm your C++ compiler is working and you can compile and run basic SKSE plugins.

## Starter Kit

The [Starter Kit](https://github.com/SkyrimScripting/SKSE_Template_StarterKit) template uses Skyrim Scripting helper libraries to make getting started on your SKSE mod authoring journey a bit easier!

To simplify building SKSE plugins and copying them to your Skyrim mods folder, our [CMake helper](https://github.com/SkyrimScripting/CMake) is used.

To simplify authoring the C++ to get up-and-running with a basic SKSE plugin, our [Plugin helper](https://github.com/SkyrimScripting/Plugin) is used.

Checkout the [Starter Kit](https://github.com/SkyrimScripting/SKSE_Template_StarterKit) to get started on your SKSE mod authoring journey (_with just a little bit of help from us!_)

They each demonstrate a different feature of SKSE.
