# SKSE Templates

> Templates of SKSE projects for Skyrim

_Follow links to templates below. Each one is in a separate "[Template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)" GitHub repository._

> All templates use [CommonLibSSE NG](https://github.com/CharmedBaryon/CommonLibSSE-NG) and should work on Skyrim SE, AE, GOG, and VR

## "Hello, world!"

This [Hello, world!](https://github.com/SkyrimScripting/SKSE_Template_HelloWorld) template is as simple as templates get!

Use this to confirm your C++ compiler is working and you can compile and run basic SKSE plugins.

## Skyrim Scripting YouTube series templates

The following templates are featured in the YouTube series* teaching SKSE development.

> `*` _currently being recorded, planned release before Christmas 2022_

They each demonstrate a different feature of SKSE.

They use lots of code comments describing the feature that they demonstrate.
